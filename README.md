With the development of industry and technology, automation systems are developing and these systems aim to reduce the workforce and maximize efficiency. Nowadays, both operators and many personnel are involved in loading heavy vehicles. Although this system requires a lot of labor, it also increases the workforce. Therefore, an automation system should be developed that will employ fewer personnel and operate at the highest level in terms of time reduction and efficiency. For example, using an automation system developed for this purpose using a database via a phone application will enable heavy vehicle drivers to quickly load their cargo into their vehicles and continue their journey quickly and efficiently. Since today, with the developing technology, vehicles are considered a smart system, this application can be added to the computers in heavy vehicles and this system can be controlled not only from the mobile phone but also from the computer in the vehicle. Since user login will be activated within the application, not everyone will be allowed to enter the system. Both the availability of information in the database and the ability of authorized persons to enter the system make the system more secure. In terms of speed and efficiency, there will be an automatic system mode in the application, and if the user needs to take a certain amount of load, he will be able to take the desired amount of load and send commands such as turning the system on and off to the system with the manual mode in the application.

In this project;

-For database, Firebase Realtime Database,

-Firebase Authentication for user login security,

-Arduino IDE and Flutter for software,

For electronics, NodeMCU V3 ESP8266 ESP-12E development board, servo motor with Arduino UNO development board, 2 HC-SR04 ultrasonic distance sensors, 5 Kg weight sensor, HX711 weight sensor amplifier and SH 1106 OLED screen were used.

In our project, while the load filling is initially determined in the electronic system as 100 grams or 50 grams in automatic mode, the desired amount of load can be taken by specifying the desired gram value via the manual command in the mobile application, and we can empty the entire warehouse as we wish with the lid open-close commands.
